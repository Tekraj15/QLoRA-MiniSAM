# LoRA-MiniSAM - A lightweight, parameter-efficient adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM)

The primary objective of LoRA-MiniSAM is to develop a lightweight, parameter-efficient adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) tailored for medical image segmentation (MIS) by combining knowledge distillation from the original SAM with ViT-H into a compact ViT-B-based encoder and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for modality-specific fine-tuning.
